## Architecture Guardrails

These rules do not change without explicit decision:

- **Cache first.** Every provider fetch must check cache before making a network call. Force-refresh is opt-in only (`force=true` / `?force=true`).
- **Normalize at the boundary.** FMP and AV responses are normalized in `financialData.js` before being written to cache. `analysisRunner` must not depend on raw provider field names.
- **Data assembly is separate from analysis.** `dataAssembler.js` owns fetching and normalization. `analysisRunner.js` owns calculations and output. Do not re-merge them.
- **Routes are thin.** Business logic belongs in services. Routes parse input, call one service function, return output.
- **Pre-collected data is the fixture path.** `data/{TICKER}-collected.json` is how frontend dev and tests avoid live provider calls for statement data.

## API Usage Safeguards

- Default `force=false` everywhere — cache is always preferred
- `CACHE_ENABLED=false` bypasses cache (dev/debug only — never set in production)
- `MAX_PROVIDER_CALLS=20` — logs a warning when provider HTTP calls exceed threshold per session
- `ANALYSIS_CACHE_TTL_MS=86400000` — analysis files older than 24 h are treated as stale and rerun
- Integration tests use `data/AAPL-collected.json` fixture by default — live tests require `RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1`
- Alpha Vantage fallback activates only when FMP returns 402/429/401/403 — not on first attempt
- Do not add retry loops, polling, or background refresh without an explicit budget check
